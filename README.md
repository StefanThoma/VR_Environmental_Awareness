# VR_Environmental_Awareness 2022
Data analysis of the "melting glacier" project.

This repository documents the analysis pipeline for the 2022 paper submitted to a specific journal (the name of which I just forgot).

You can just open the analysis.html file and look through the analysis. 
I recommend opening it in the safari browser. 
Chrome did not display some pdfs for me. 
Alternatively, you can run the analysis.Rmd file. 
However, some plots will only be displayed in safari. 


Data has been anonymised. 
Data cleaning and the IAT scoring process has been conducted in a separate file.
